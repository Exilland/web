And here we are, this is our last alpha patch. It took us some extra time, but things should go smoother from here on out. So, what's new in this patch?

- Achievements (and rewards)
- Localization
- Bugfixes and improvements

### Achievements (and rewards)

In the main menu (which we've redone in preparations to the future changes) we have a new button: "Achievements". They are a bit tricky to complete, but if you do, you will have a new card set (7-8 cards each) available in your next runs in the shop. We plan to expand on them in the future and allow player to select which card sets they want to see in their run.

### Localization

We remade how tooltips and various in-game text is handled to allow us to translate the game. First available localization is Russian.

### Bugfixes and improvements

- Remade main menu
- You can now skip trading in stations (stations will remain on the map)
- The shop saves it state correctly (you could reroll infinitly by restarting the game before)
- In-battle visual improvements
- New mechanics: Remove (remove cards from this battle), Self Damage (or Break, you lose health for some beneficial effect) and Repair (restore health), available as achievements rewards
